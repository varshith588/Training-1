variables:-
***********
- variables are used to store the data / values / literals.

types of variables:-
*******************
1.var :- re-intitialization is possible
        re-decalration is possible
2.let:- re-intitialization is possible
        re-decalration is not possible
3.const:-  re-intitialization is not possible
        re-decalration is not  possible

ex: - var username = "Rakesh";
    console.log(username);

    - extension of javascript file  must be ".js".

    console.log() :- it is a method to print the output in the developer console.
    document.writeln():- it is a method to print the output on the UI.

what is comment?
-comments are the ignored lined by the browser.
-to give an information to the developers.

two type of comments in js:-
****************************
html :- <!-- comment to be done -->
css :- /* ulkdsjvl */

js:-
1.single line comment - (//)
2.multi-line comment - (/**/)


what is data types?
-datatypes used to specify what kind of data stored in the variable.

types of data types:-
*********************
1.primitive data types:-
- they are built-in
- immutable
- they can store only a single values
    -string
    -number
    -boolean
    -undefined
    -null
    -symbol
    -bigint

2.non-primtitive data types:-
- they are user defined
- mutable
- they can store multiple values.
    -array
    -functions
    -objects
    -math , date , json

Strings:-
**********
-sequence of characters enclosed within "" , '' , ``(template literals/backtiks)

number:-
- -2^53-1 to +2^53-1 upto this range we consider as number data type.
- beyond this range it will be bigint.

boolean :- true / false.

undefined:- variable is declared but not initialized with the value.

null:-null is empty value / absence of an object.
- return type of null is "object".

bigint:- any value exceed the range of number dattype we consider that as bigint.
- any value sufix with "n" will be bigint.

Operators:-
**************
- Operators is a special type of symbols used to perform some operations on operands.
ex - 10(operand1) +(operator) 20(operand2)

- unary
- binary
- ternary(operand1 ? operand2 : operand3)

1.arithmatic Operators
2.assignment operator
3.relational operator
4.logical operator

1.arithmatic Operators:-
- addition
- substraction
- multiplication
- division
- modulus
- expoenentail
- increment(++) :- increment will happen with one value
    - pre-increment :- increment before execution
    - post-increment :- increment after execution
- decrement(--) :- decrmenrted by 1
    - pre-decrement
    - post-decrement

concatenation :- adding two or more strings.
typecasting :- converting one datatype into another datatype.
NaN :- Not a Number :- 

2.assignment operator:-
- = , += , -= , *= ,/= , %= , **=

3.relational operator
- which are used to compare two values.
- == , === , != , !== , > , >= , < , <=
- returns always a boolean.
what is the difference between "==" and "==="?
-"==" - it will check only values not a data type.
-"===" - it will check both values and data types.
- "!=" - similar to == it will check only values not a data types
- "!==" - checks both value and data types.

4.Logical operators:-
AND(&&)- when both sides condition is true then it will return true else false.
OR(||) :- when both side is true or any one side is true it will return true else false.
NOT(!):- if true it becomes false and vice-versa. 

Decision making statments:-
****************************
-if:- it will work for true statments
- if else
- else if ladder
-switch
- ternary

prompt():- this method is used to collect the data from the users.

*******

Looping statments:
*****************
- to excute the block of codes repeatedly.
for Loop:-
-will  be used when the exact iteration count will be known.
syntax :- for(intitialization;condition;updation){
            //statment
            }
while:-
- will be used when we dont know the iteration count.
syntax :- while(condition){
                //statment
                }

do-while:-
- while be used when we dont know the iteration count.
syntax :- do{
            //statment
            }while(condition)

-what is the difference between "break" and "continue" keywords.
break - when condition satisfied it will terminate the loop
permenently

continue-when the condition satisfies it will skip that particular
condition.

functions:-
************
- function is a block of code used to execute specific task assigned to it.
- function is a non-primitive data type.
- functions can be reusable.

syntax :-    function function_name(optional parameters){// function decalration
                    //statements
                    }
                function_name(arguments);

Types of functions:-
*********************
1.named function :- function which is having a name and invoked with the same name.
2.anonymus function :-function which doesnot have  a name to declare and to invoke.
3.function expression:- anonymus function decalration is assigned to a variable 
    and invoked with the same variable.
4.Immediate invoke function expression(IIFE):-
    - once the function is created immediatley it should be invoked.
    - it can be executed only once.

5.Arrow function:-it is used to concise the normal function syntax.
syntax :-  ()=>{};
- arrow function is similar to anonymus function.
6.Higher order function
7.Callback function
- closure
