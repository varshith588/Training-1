#Single page application:
-Only one HTML file
-No page reload or refresh

#Multi page application:
-Multiple HTML files
-Page reload or refresh occurs

-React is mainly used to create single page applications

# What is VIrtual DOM
-Virtual DOM is the virtual representation of the UI which is kept in the memory and later
 synced with the real DOM with the help of a library called ReactDOM.
-The updation of Real DOM with virtual DOM
-The entire process of updating the real DOM with the help of virtual DOM is called as reconciliation
-Diffing algorithm is used to perform one-to-one mapping.

# JSX
-JSX stands for JavaScript and XML.
-JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension used to create HTML-like markup in React.
-Actual way to create an element in React is by using a method called as
	React.createElement("tagname",{property:"value"}/null,content/children)

Ex: let ele = React.createElement(
		"div",
		{ className: "App" },
		React.createElement("h1", null, "Header")
  	);

-JSX is not a part of React but it is recommended to use in React

##Rules of JSX:
1) Every element irrespective of paired/unpaired tag, both must be closed.
Ex: <h1></h1>
	<input/>

2) If more than one jsx element is used then they must be wrapped under one parent element.
Ex: <section>
      <h1 style={{ color: "red" }}>Name: Subhapreet Patro</h1>
      <input />
    </section>

## JSX expression
-It is used to call the variable or mathematical expression inside the element
Syntax: <h1>{variable/expression}</h1>

# Components:
-Components are the files or modules which consist of JavaScript related logicswhich can be reused
-Components are divided into two types:
1) Class based components(CBC)
2) Functional based components(FBC)

(i) Class based components(CBC):
-CBC is similar to JavaScript ES6 class
-CBC are "stateful" components because of default state object present inside the class

-Syntax: 
class Person{
	constructor(name,age){
		this.name=name;
		this.age=age;
	}
}

class Child extends Person{
	constructor(name,age,city){
		super(name,age);
		this.city=city;
	}
}

-Actual Syntax:
class App extends React.Component{
	render(){
		return(
			//JSX element
		)
	}
}

export default App;

(ii) Functional based components(FBC):
-FBC are similar to JavaScript functions
-FBC are "stateless" because there is no state object until React v16.8

-Syntax:
function App(){
	return(
		//JSX element
	)
}

export default App;

OR

const App()=>{
	return(
		//JSX element
	)
}
export default App;

Note: While creating a React Component the names must start with capital letters
-Extension of a component file must be .jsx or .js
-How to call a component
	<App/> OR <App></App>
